- ðŸ‘‹  Hi, Iâ€™m @GlobalMolotov
- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently learning my way through Arch Linux as a means to produce audio from analog input with various instruments via an interface... 
      this is my first time experimenting with a Linux distro but I'm confident in my ability to learn new tricks, even at my age 
      If you are also using a Linux distro as a platform for music production, feel free to drop me any info or helpful tools you think I may find myself 
      in need of on my journey.
      otherwise, godspeed and wish me luck
